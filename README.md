## Watch up to 3 minutes and 46 seconds, and then remain in the remaining part copying the part of the script and save it as l.py. 

The script is used to automatically like a particular YouTube video with multiple accounts

First, open Chrome file location and bypass the location restriction using an extension such as Touch VPN. In my case, the Chrome location(use start in: path) is

C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application

click window button and search cmd and enter

cd C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application (1st line in cmd)

in line enter

chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=""(in "enter your localhost path here")

Next, enter this command into the terminal, replacing "enter your localhost path here" with your localhost path:

For example, in my case it is:

chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\Bots\Chromedriver\Localhost" (2nd line in cmd make sure you replace the localhost path)

then again open new terminal in that folder enter l.py or double click on l.py

This will open the YouTube video URL in Chrome, automatically like it with multiple accounts, and switch between accounts to hit the likes.

# "You must login with your 10+ accounts,

# after login with 10 accs add these extension
https://shorturl.at/mtAER

and each account must have 10+ brand accounts to hit auto-likes. In the 17th line of the script, replace the URL with the YouTube video URL you want to like.

That's it! The URL will open in the previously opened localhost Chrome and 100+ auto likes will be done automatically.

Finally, in the command prompt, enter "pip install Random" and hit enter to install the necessary library.

## 👉 Note:Every time YouTube updates the code, it varies. So, open the YouTube video, press 'Ctrl+Shift+C' to open the developer tools,

## then copy the 'Like' button's XPath, CSS, or JavaScript path. Replace it in the code and press 'Ctrl+H' to find and replace the same element in the code.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 👉 "If you want 1000 auto likes, follow these steps in Chrome settings:

Click on the account logo near the top
Go to 'Other profiles.'
Click the '+ Add' button.
Log in with 10 different Gmail accounts, with each Gmail account containing 10 brand accounts.
Repeat this process for a total of 8 profiles, with each profile containing 10 emails (each email having 10 brand accounts).

## Once you've set up the profiles, open each one and double-click on the Python (L.py) file. That's it!"

👉Note:-

👉If you have the latest version of Selenium, the code may not run

👉open cmd and enter pip uninstall selenium

And enter

pip install selenium==4.2.0

and hit enter

and

python -c "import selenium; print(selenium.version)"
